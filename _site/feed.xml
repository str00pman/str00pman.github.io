<p>Looking at the visible light spectrum, the two former combinations look intuitive: we perceive the combination of two colors as the color sitting inbetween in the spectrum. Our visual system interpolates them, somehow <em>averaging</em> the wavelengths.</p>

<p>Thus, shouldn’t we see <em>blue+red</em> as something yellowish, greenish, or an average of these colors? Instead, we perceive this combination as violet, which sits at an extremity of the spectrum. This question has be haunting me for a while now, so I will start digging around the internet and gathering my findings here.</p>

<p>I just went on a trip abroad and I noticed a few things about my poop I want to share with you.</p>

<p>Not a problem, not especially cool, but different.</p>

<p>First day is normal: feels like home, business as usual.</p>

<p>On the second day, things slowly start to feel off: in the morning it’s ok but a night it tickles a little bit. Feels different, smells different.</p>

<p>Then I got to a new stage in my poop cycle. My body gave new signals that I did not know how to interpret. Do I <em>really</em> want to go poop or should I wait a little bit? Is it going to be soft or hard? Is it gonna need a little push or is Newton enough? Not talking about gas.</p>

<p>I have a few theories about why this happens. Let me collect them together and I will upload a new post later this week.</p>
