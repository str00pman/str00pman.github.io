The author of this blog loves painting, and knows for a fact that <span style="color:red">*red*</span>*+*<span style="color:#F1C40F">*yellow*</span>*=*<span style="color:orange">*orange*</span>, as well as <span style="color:blue">*blue*</span>*+*<span style="color:#F1C40F">*yellow*</span>*=*<span style="color:green">*green*</span> and <span style="color:blue">*blue*</span>*+*<span style="color:red">*red*</span>*=*<span style="color:#B233FF">*violet*</span>. But why?

Looking at the visible light spectrum, the two former combinations look intuitive: we perceive the combination of two colors as the color sitting inbetween in the spectrum. Our visual system interpolates them, somehow *averaging* the wavelengths.

Thus, shouldn't we see *blue+red* as something yellowish, greenish, or an average of these colors? Instead, we perceive this combination as violet, which sits at an extremity of the spectrum. This question has be haunting me for a while now, so I will start digging around the internet and gathering my findings here.

## Monochromatic vs polychromatic light

A light is made of electromagnetic radiations. When all these electromagnetic radiations have the same wavelength, the light is said to be *monochromatic*. If this wavelength is in the visible range, the resulting light will have one of the colors in the spectrum above.

A *polychromatic* light contains radiations of different wavelengths. Such light may have colors that can't be found in the visible spectrum above, e.g., brown, gray, pink. It may also have a color that *looks like* one from the spectrum above (to our human eye), e.g.:


<p style="text-align: center;">480nm blue + 580nm yellow (polychromatic) ~= 530nm green (monochromatic).</p>


Digital cameras are very good at fooling our eye, making us see any visible light with only combinations of three colors (c.f. [RGB Color Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model)). Even though the rainbow below contains all visible wavelength, the picture itself is nothing more than mixtures of red, green and blue.

## Human perception of light

When exposed to electromagnetic radiations, our eye does not measure the wavelength, but rather quantify the amount of red, green and blue (c.f. [Color Vison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision)).

next: opponent process theory?
