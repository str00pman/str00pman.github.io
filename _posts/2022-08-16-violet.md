The author of this blog loves painting, and knows for a fact that <span style="color:red">*red*</span>*+*<span style="color:#F1C40F">*yellow*</span>*=*<span style="color:orange">*orange*</span>, as well as <span style="color:blue">*blue*</span>*+*<span style="color:#F1C40F">*yellow*</span>*=*<span style="color:green">*green*</span> and <span style="color:blue">*blue*</span>*+*<span style="color:red">*red*</span>*=*<span style="color:violet">*violet*</span>. But why?

Looking at the visible light spectrum, the two former combinations look intuitive: we perceive the combination of two colors as the color sitting inbetween in the spectrum. Our visual system interpolates them, somehow *averaging* the wavelengths.

Thus, shouldn't we see *blue+red* as something yellowish, greenish, or an average of these colors? Instead, we perceive this combination as violet, which sits at an extremity of the spectrum. This question has be haunting me for a while now, so I will start digging around the internet and gathering my findings here.
