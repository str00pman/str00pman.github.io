Hello dear chess lovers,

I've made a puzzle just for you: from the position above, **white to play and win**.

It is my first puzzle and, honestly, the most beautiful one. Tell me in the comment if you found the solution and what's your ELO rating.

Thanks to *lichess.org* for the great website, and *stockfish* which helped me validate this puzzle.
