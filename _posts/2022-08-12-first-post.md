Hey :sweat_smile:

I just went on a trip abroad and I noticed a few things about my poop I want to share with you.

Not a problem, not especially cool, but different.

First day is normal: feels like home, business as usual.

On the second day, things slowly start to feel off: in the morning it's ok but a night it tickles a little bit. Feels different, smells different. 

Then I got to a new stage in my poop cycle. My body gave new signals that I did not know how to interpret. Do I *really* want to go poop or should I wait a little bit? Is it going to be soft or hard? Is it gonna need a little push or is Newton enough? Not talking about gas.

I have a few theories about why this happens. Let me collect them together and I will upload a new post later this week.
